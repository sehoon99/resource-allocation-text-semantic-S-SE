## ðŸ“Œ Hungarian Algorithm

### Description

The Hungarian algorithm solves the minimum cost matching (assignment) problem. Given a cost matrix `Perf`, it finds the optimal binary matching matrix `Matching` that minimizes the total cost of matched pairs.

### Function

```python
matching, cost = Hungarian(Perf)
```

### Arguments

- `Perf (numpy.ndarray)`  
  A 2D matrix of shape `(M, N)` representing the cost (or performance) of assigning row `i` to column `j`.  
  - Use `np.inf` for disallowed assignments.
  - For **maximum performance matching**, use `-Perf` before calling the function.

### Returns

- `Matching (numpy.ndarray)`  
  A binary matrix (0 or 1) of shape `(M, N)`, where `Matching[i, j] = 1` means task `i` is assigned to resource `j`.

- `Cost (float)`  
  The total cost of the assignment (sum of matched `Perf[i, j]` values).  
  For maximization problems, return `-Cost` after inputting `-Perf`.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from my_hungarian import Hungarian

Perf = np.array([[4, 1, 3],
                 [2, 0, 5],
                 [3, 2, 2]], dtype=float)

matching, cost = Hungarian(Perf)

print("Matching:\n", matching)
print("Cost:", cost)
```

**Output:**

```
Matching:
[[0 1 0]
 [1 0 0]
 [0 0 1]]
Cost: 5.0
```

## ðŸ“Š Simulation: Semantic-aware Resource Allocation

### Overview

This simulation evaluates spectral efficiency (S-SE) under two scenarios:

1. **Ideal System**: Uses Shannon-based throughput and Hungarian matching.
2. **Proposed System**: Uses precomputed semantic utility (`sem_table`) and Hungarian matching.

### Key Features

- Rayleigh fading and large-scale path loss based on 3GPP LTE macro-cell model
- Hungarian algorithm-based channel assignment
- Symbol-based semantic efficiency selection using lookup table
- Comparison plots of S-SE for ideal vs. proposed schemes


### Notes

- Make sure your semantic utility table is located at:
  ```
  /content/drive/MyDrive/sem_table.csv
  ```
  and formatted as a tab-delimited `.csv`.

- You can modify the following simulation parameters:
  - `n_devices`: number of users
  - `channel`: number of channels (default: 9)
  - `t_factor`: bits per word
  - `p_values`: transmit power(s) in dB
  - `episode`: number of iteration 
  -

## ðŸ”§ Future Extensions

- Add support for dynamic channel availability
- Integrate reinforcement learning-based feature selection
- Real-time semantic feature compression
